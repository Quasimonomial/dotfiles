## Quasi's Mac Osx Setup

### Instructions

1. Update the operating system
  * `sudo softwareupdate --install --all --restart`
2. Install the xcode tools
  * `xcode-select â€”install`
3. Set osx preferences
  * `sh .osx.sh`
4. Set up Brew and install packages
  * `sh brew_setup.sh` -> This installs brew and sets up the path properly
  * You will need a new terminal session for brew to work
  * Then run `sh brew_assets.sh` --> this installs all of my preferred programs
5. Install these separately, as they do not have brew installs
  * [bear](https://bear.app/)
6. Set up Mouse and Keyboard with Logitech Options and Karabiner

    * this can be uninstalled with `uninstall_oh_my_zsh`
  * Faff about with your `ohmyzsh` settings for about an hour
